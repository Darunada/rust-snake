# Snake Game

[![Rustc Version 1.36+](https://img.shields.io/badge/rustc-1.36+-lightgray.svg)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2017/02/02/Rust-1.15.html)

This is just a quick and dirty snake game I wrote in Rust.  It took me approximately 5 hours of effort to build this 
game, and I have been learning Rust for about two weeks.

Thanks for looking!

Installation
--------------------------------------
This game is built in Rust.  Is this your first time?

- You have Rust installed, preferably via `rustup`
- You have `~/.cargo/bin` added to your PATH variable
- Build and run in one step with `cargo run`
- or, Build the executable with 

```
$ cargo build --release
  ... builds in a few minutes ...
$ ./target/release/snake
```

If compilation fails, you may need a ggez dependency.  See: [BuildingForEveryPlatform.md](https://github.com/ggez/ggez/blob/master/docs/BuildingForEveryPlatform.md).
